# Punchkeyboard

Punchkeyboard is an open-source keyboard for virtual reality, enhanced with autocorrect and next word prediction functionality for a swift typing experience. It was created with Unity and written in C#. The built in prediction is based on Reddit conversations, however the repository contains functionality for creating custom dictionaries for personalised suggestions as well.
